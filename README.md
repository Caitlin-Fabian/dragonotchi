A virtual pet that is reminiscent to the 90's pocket pet, Tamagotchi. Once you hatch your little dragon, you are now a parent and have to care for it by playing, feeding and cleaning after it.

Some features include:
- Playing with a ball
- Eating a chicken leg
- Cleaning after it goes to the bathroom
- Lives
- Death

## Material

Using an ESP8266, an 16x16 LED panel, and an android mobile application made with Kotlin, we were able to create this hardware/software mix of a project. The point of this project was to create a cute interactive pet that someone could have sitting on their desk.
